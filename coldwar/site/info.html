			<h2>Methods</h2>
			<h3>Military Force <small>The Hungarian Revolution 1956</small></h3>
			<p>The hungarian revolution started on October 23, 1956 as an organized march of students accross The People's republic of Hungary, protesting the soviet rule. The country quickly degraded as students attempted to infiltrate and control key communications assets such as radio buildings. The state police retaliated and opened fire upon the students, causing the situation to only further escalate. The quick spread of the revolt caused the collapse of the governement and many small militias to form, fighting against the state police and the soviet troops. Soviet supporters were executed. As November started, the violence decreased with a new government in power dissolving the state police and pledging its withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact. Where the Soviets initially agreed to withdraw their troops, the plans changed instead to a method of Military Force. On the 4th of November Soviet troops marched many key locations, crushing all opposition. By the beginning of January, any inklings of dissent had been exterminated, fully ratifying Soviet rule.</p>
		<h3>Economic Assistance <small>The Marshall Plan</small></h3>
		<p>An extension of the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan was developed by the United States as another method to fight against communism. Within the plan, nations destroyed by World War II were granted economic assistance to facilitate the reconstruction of their countries. The hope behind offering this assistance was that if they were getting help from the free, communist-opposing nations they would not resort to communism. This same tactic was employed by red states, with the same intention of spreading their own ideology. Eventually, ecnomic assistance would degrade into a race between communist and free states, both attempting to assure the crippled state would accept their assistance and also their ideology.</p>
		<h3>Arms Race <small>Nuclear fear and mutually assured destruction</small></h3>
		<blockquote><small>Arms Race</small>Refers to the quick stockpiling of arms and an increase in military spending in order to have a greater amount of weaponry or military power than an opponent. The two superpowers quickly accumulated more and more military power until the military expectation went supernova and caused the collapse of the Cold War.</blockquote>
		<p></p>
		<blockquote><small>Brinksmanship</small>Policy or actions pushed to the limits -- or the brink of -- reasonable safety. Colloquially might be described as playing with fire, the term was coined by Secretary of State John Dulles under the Eisenhower administration in the context of nuclear war, and the mutually assured destruction that would become inevitable should the increasing threats of nuclear action ever come to pass.</blockquote>
		<h3>Space race <small>Sputnik</small></h3>
		<p>The United States was confident that, as a nation, they were the most advanced in terms of space travel and exploration. However, this confidence was shattered in 1957 when the Russians successfully sent a dog, Sputnik, to the moon, beating the United States by over a decade. The psychological significance of this Russian success is very significant, because it raised questions that if the Russians were ahead of the US in out-of-this-world technology, perhaps they were leagues ahead in terms of in-this-world technology.</p>
		<h3>Propaganda <small></small></h3>
		<div class="row"><div class="span6"><div class="thumbnail"><img src="commieprop.jpg" /><p><strong>Communist Propoganda</strong></p></div></div>
		<div class="span6"><div class="thumbnail"><img src="mericaprop.jpg" /><p><strong>American Propoganda</strong></p></div></div></div>
		<h3>Espionage <small>The CIA and KGB</small></h3>
		<p>Because the Cold War was, in the majority, fought with psychological warfare focused on convincing the opposing side that your side had a bigger stick, there was a natural increase in espionage. This era saw the creation of the CIA and the Russian equivalent, the KGB. Both sides were heavily involved in sending spies into enemy territory to learn secrets about weaponry and politics afflicting their opponents. Because of rampant espionage, the term McCarthyism was coined, describing the acusations of disloyalty or treason, without necessarily retaining evidence of the crime. The accusations, based on illogic and fear, are comparable to witch hunts. The period of the 1940s to 1950s became known as the Second Red Scare, because of the near universal fear of communism and communist spies. <blockquote><small>Deterrence</small>The theory of deterrence, in the context of the Cold War, states that even an inferior nuclear force has the devastating capacity to deter even a vastly superior nuclear force from ever taking action. Deterrence goes hand in hand with the idea of mutually assured destruction; the idea that if one party takes action, this action will inevitably ensure their own destruction as well as their enemies.</blockquote></p>
		<h3>Alliances <small>NATO and the Warsaw Pact</small></h3>
		<p>During the Cold War, the world was essentially divided in two. <blockquote><small>Bi-Polar World</small>A world that exists as polar opposites of the other side; that is, two heavily conflicting, opposite ideals exist as two superpowers controlling the world. In the context of the Cold War, the two sides of the bi-polar world existed in the forms of Democracy vs. Communism</blockquote> 
Britain and France initially signed the Treaty of Brussels
		</p>
		<h3>Prestige Race <small>The Olympic Games</small></h3>
		<p>During the cold war the Olympic Games gained even greater importance than usual. The prestige of taking home the gold was desirable to both the United States and Russia to prove to the other how much greater each nation, and by extension each political ideology, was. In 1956 and 1960, the Soviet Union was victorious over the United States.</p>

				<p>The subject of the cartoon, an elephant, is used to create the colloquial image of "the elephant in the room". In this context, the teetering tower of McCarthyism, the accusation of others' loyalty being tied to the communists without the burden of proof. The tower of McCarthyism is depicted as being haphazardly constructed out of red paint--symbolism for the accusing of communist supporters as "red"--and the elephant is being forced onto it. This shows that everyone realized, though none truly acted otherwise, that the practice of McCarthyism was clearly flawed, and that anyone involved could easily be convicted as a communist spies, despite their loyalties lying wholly with the west. The wickedly gleeful looks on all the politicians faces emphasize the enjoyment gleaned from crucifying others, as a method of glorifying themselves. </p> <br /><br /><blockquote>The junior senator of Wisconsin, by his reckless charges, has so preyed upon the fears and hatreds and prejudices of the AMerican people that he has started a prairie fire which neither he nor anyone else may be able to control. <small>James William Fullbright</small></blockquote>

				<li class="span6"><p>During the Cold War, direct lines were established, in the form of a red telephone, from Moscow to Washington D.C. The idea of the these phones was to implement direct communication between the leaders of the opposing parties to ensure open communication between the two. However, this picture depicts the two on the telephone, angry and unwavering in their opinions of the other. The dividing line is a rigid lightning bolt, symbolizing the severing between the two, and the lack of communication, despite the best attempts of either capital.<blockquote><small>Detente</small>An easing or relaxing of political tension or policies. Detente occured in the 1970s--roughly the middle of the Cold War--as Washington and Moscow engaged in treaty talks and peaceful diplomatic communication. It also saw the installation of the red telephone, a direct line between the two capitals for immediate, urgent communication in time of dire stress.</blockquote></p></li>
