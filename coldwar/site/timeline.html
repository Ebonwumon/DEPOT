Eventually, Israel gained back about half the land planned, while Egypt and Jordan the other. Jerusalem experienced similar division, Israel controlling the western half and Jordan the eastern half. Thousands of Arabs moved from Israel controlled areas to become refugees in Arab controlled regions. (Confrontational)</p></li>

On June 25 the northern communist troops invaded South Korea, which was deplored by the United Nations as a violation of international peace and therefore demanded the Communist withdraw.  UN troops were sent in to aid the South because the U.S.S.R. was boycotting the Security Council and failed to veto the action. Then Soviet tanks were provided and Chinese soldiers as support for the North. (Confrontational)</p></li>

<blockquote><small>Self-Determination</small>The idea that a nation has the right to its own sovereignty, and the ability to construct individual policies that affect their own nation without outside influence. Self-determination was assaulted throughout the Cold War as nations were attacked, sanctioned and discriminated against because of their political ideology, rather than any particular action or inaction the nation underwent.</blockquote></p></li></ul></div><hr>

 <div class="row"><ul class="thumbnails"><li class="span8"><p>Prague Spring: a reform movement pushed forward by communist party leader Alexander Dubcek that allowed greater freedom of the press, greater freedom in certain sectors of industry, and allowed the formation of other political parties.

His successor surrenders unconditionally to the North. American intervention had been justified by the theory that if the region became communist soon the neighboring countries would follow; this was proved invalid after the war. The United States was also left to inflation costs, from the war, for the next eight years. (Cooperative)<p></li>
