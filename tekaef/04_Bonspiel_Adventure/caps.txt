$cap[0]="Mmkay! So this week's TEKAEF was done at a Bonspiel (for
those of you who aren't Canadian-literate, that's a curling
tournament) during a break. We had ingredients for either deviled
eggs or omlettes. I chose the latter. Of course, to partition
resources better, they shoved us in groups of three, so this one
actually fufills the _friends_ part of tekaef";
$cap[1]="So I wisk up my eggs (the small bowl is mine). My eggs are
whisked better than his, I assume you agree.";
$cap[2]="I originally put a _lot_ of oil in my pan, I'd say a good
five tablespoons, but then the teacher came along and went all
health-nazi on my ass and dumped some of the oil into another groups
pan. Of course, I stole it back as soon as she wasn't looking, but
unfortunately, I couldn't get it all back, so I could only work with
like, three tablespoons of oil. Also, the black elbow you see in the
picture is the teacher. Apparently she doesn't understand a little
concept called GET THE HELL OUT OF MY SHOT";
$cap[3]="I throw it in the pan, then throw on the meat, and it smells
_so friggin' sexy_. Though I'll admit, all the oil made it look
peculiar";
$cap[4]="So there it is in my pan, all folded over and looking
totally sexy and, dare I say it, _like an omlette should_, but I
gotta fry the other side so... (insert whoosh-esque noises here)";
$cap[5]="Godammit. It now looks nothing like an omlette should";
$cap[6]="Well... If it's not an omlette, might as well make it an
english muffin!";
$cap[7]="I throw significant amounts of (stolen when the teacher wasn't looking) oil on the frying pan, and try to fry the whole muffing to toast it and melt cheese and such. Took too long _trying_ to take pictures (which I failed to do) and didn't pay enough attention causing it to burn. But no matter, this is not a challenge for me. BECAUSE I AM EBON! I R OMNIPOTENT. I USE KNIFE TO REMOVE BURN!";
$cap[8]="And they're all done. Look at how sexy they all look. Mine
especially. If you're wondering why I didn't document my group
member's process, it's because I don't give a crap about them. Neither
should you.";
$cap[9]="This is mine. It is truly a happy meal, and easily the
sexiest of the lot";
$cap[10]="And here's nameless group member number one's. Nothing really
exciting. Moving on.";
$cap[11]="Ditto.";
$cap[12]="This one didn't come from my group. I was walking by and it
simply looked so awful that I couldn't help but take a picture.";
