#FGT Mainsite#

A Starcraft II team site using the [DEPOT](http://github.com/Ebonwumon/DEPOT) backend for processing.

This project uses a completely open and unrestricted liscense. You may take and do whatever you want with my code without attribution.
Down the line the project *may* change to GPL liscensing, but nothing more restrictive than that, it will always be open source.
