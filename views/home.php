    <div class="span4"><h2>History</h2>
      <p>Team [FGT] was created one dark and stormy evening on the night of February 18th, 2012, through the ingenius naming capabilites of FGTbonywonix.
  Shortly thereafter, [FGT] was asked to represent the Greater Edmonton Area, and Canada as a whole in the Olympics, a relatively non-challenging task, easily taking Gold
  in all their Starcraft related events. However nice the Olympics win may be, it would not last, for the team saw their potential, and retaining their amateur status was
  simply impossible to accomplish. After playing Kim Jong-Un in a showmatch, the wager of which being nuclear disarmament of North Korea, the team proceeded to use their 
contacts with the American government to acquisition nuclear weaponry, and assert a hostile and quick takeover of the now non-nuclear North Korea. The large standing army of North Korea 
rapidly surrendered, but their skills would be greatly required later, when South Korea, distraught with jealousy as the GSL took up residence in their neighbour to the North (where all the greatest 
talet now obviously resided) decided to wage war. Lines between reality and video games became blurred as standing armies duked it out underneath holographic carriers and vikings, a 
showmatch-enhancing technology developed with ease by the resident genius FGTbonywonix. South Korea soon fell, in a close game between FGTShuffle and IMMVP, but ultimately an inevitible 
outcome. That brings us to today. Next, the world.
