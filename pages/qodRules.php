The question of the day is a question that is answered by the computer 
science class every day. Points are awarded to the student who guesses 
the closest to the answer (without going over). IN the case of a tie, 
points are awarded equally to all who tied.

<ol>
<li>You may only submit one answer, and once you have submitted, you 
cannot change your answer.
<li>All answers must be APPROPRIATE and NOT DESIGNED TO BREAK THE SITE. 
Disqualification could ensue, should you break this rule.
<li>Price is right rules: you must get closest without going over. For 
example, if you were guessing Mr. Chung's age, and Person A guesses 24, 
and Person B guesses 29, and Mr. Chung is actually 28, Person A wins, 
because Person B went over, despite being closer.
<li>You must register in your actual block. Prizes are awarded Per Block 
(the winner from each block gets a pizza at the end of the term)
